## 📌 Note for Reviewers / Tutors

For security reasons, the personal Spoonacular API key is not included in this repository.

Until an API key is added, mock recipes are provided so the core features of the application can still be explored and tested.
If you want to test live, Add your Spoonacular API key in script.js at the placeholder:

const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
