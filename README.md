🍴 Recipe Finder – RecipeRealm
📌 Overview

The Recipe Finder (RecipeRealm) is a web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It was designed to allow users to explore and search for recipes based on ingredients, cuisine, diet, and cooking time.
External APIs were integrated for real-time recipe fetching, and mock recipes were also included to ensure functionality even without an API key.

🚀 Features

🔍 Recipes can be searched based on ingredients.

🥗 Recipes can be filtered by cuisine, diet, and cooking time.

🎲 A random recipe can be generated through the Secret Recipe feature.

❤️ Recipes can be saved in a Favorites list.

📂 Recipes are organized into categories (Desserts, Drinks, Salads, etc.).

📖 Detailed instructions, nutrition information, and images are displayed in a recipe modal.

⏳ A loading spinner was implemented for smoother user experience.

📱 The design was made responsive to function on both desktop and mobile devices.

📌 Note for Reviewers / Tutors

For security reasons, the personal Spoonacular API key was not included in this repository.
To enable the live recipe fetching functionality, a free API key may be generated from Spoonacular
 and inserted into the script.js file at the placeholder shown below:

const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";


Until then, mock recipes have been provided so that the primary features of the application may still be explored and tested without an API key.
